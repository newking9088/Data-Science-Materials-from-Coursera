# Data-Science-Materials-from-Coursera
As lots of people are showing great interest towards Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning  and Artificial Intelligence, I thought it would help people having access to the most useful books and other concise reading materials. Here, in this repo, I have listed several cheat sheets starting from how to use GitHub and some courses that I took from coursera:

1. Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
   - Applied Social Network in Python Analysis
   - Applied Text Mining in Python
   - Applied Machine Learning in Python
   - Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
   - Introduction to Data Science in Python

2. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

3. Python Data Structure

4. Python Classes and Inheritance

5. Understanding and Visualizing Data With Python

6. Data Science Orientation

7. Getting Started with AWS Machine Learning

8. The Data Scientist's Toolbox

9. What is Data Science

I have included detailed reading materials and some useful notes for some courses mentioned above in detail but for some courses may have only few relevant materials.
